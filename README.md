# CLASSIFING KYPHOSIS DISEASE USING:

* DECISION TREES CLASSIFIER
* RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER
* LOGISTIC REGRESSION
* SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Kyphosis is an exaggerated, forward rounding of the back and which can occur at any age. Kyphosis can appear in infants or teenagers as a result to malformation of the spine of the spinal bones over time.

This file contains codes of various ML-algorithms on the Kyphosis dataset to predict if the Kyphosis would return after surgery.

## DATASET SHORT DESCRIPTION
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/abbasit/kyphosis-dataset

The kyphosis data frame has:
* 81 rows
* 4 columns
and represents data on children who have had corrective spinal surgery.

Data INPUTS:
* Age: in months
* Number: the number of vertebrae involved
* Start: the number of the first (topmost) vertebra operated on.

Data OUTPUTS:
* Kyphosis: a factor with levels absent present indicating if a kyphosis (a type of deformation) was present after the operation.
